## Simple E-commerce Website Redesign

During this project, I worked on redesigning a small e-commerce platform to improve user experience and increase conversion rates.

### Research Phase

I started by conducting user interviews with 8 customers to understand their shopping behaviors and pain points. The main issues identified were:

- Confusing navigation structure
- Slow checkout process
- Poor mobile experience

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "73%",
subquote-text: "of users abandoned cart due to complex checkout"
}

### Solution

Based on the research findings, I redesigned the entire user flow focusing on simplicity and clarity.

{
type: "quote-subtitle",
quote-text: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication",
subquote-text: "Leonardo da Vinci"
}

The new design reduced checkout steps from 6 to 3 and implemented a mobile-first approach that improved usability across all devices.

### Results

The redesigned website launched after 3 months of development and testing. The results exceeded expectations:

{
type: "data-point", 
data-text: "45%",
subquote-text: "increase in conversion rate within first month"
}

This project taught me the importance of user-centered design and how small changes can have significant impact on business metrics.
