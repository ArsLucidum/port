## Test Project with Callout

This is a test project to verify the callout component works correctly.

### Sample Section

Here's some regular text before the callout.

{
type: "callout",
text: "Important consideration: How might we ensure this design works for users with accessibility needs?"
}

More text after the callout.

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "95%",
subquote-text: "of users found the new design more accessible"
}

End of test content.
