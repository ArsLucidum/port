## Healthcare Patient Portal Redesign - Improving Access to Medical Information

This 6-month project involved redesigning a patient portal used by over 50,000 patients to access medical records, schedule appointments, and communicate with healthcare providers.

### Problem Definition

The existing portal had significant usability issues that affected patient care and satisfaction:

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "34%",
subquote-text: "of patients couldn't complete basic tasks independently"
}

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "127",
subquote-text: "average support calls per day related to portal issues"
}

Initial user research revealed that the portal was particularly challenging for older adults and patients with limited digital literacy.

text: "Healthcare should be about healing, not struggling with technology."
}

### Research & User Understanding

I conducted extensive research with diverse patient groups:

- 25 in-depth interviews with patients aged 18-82
- 12 interviews with healthcare staff
- Analysis of 6 months of support ticket data
- Accessibility audit with assistive technology users

Key findings:

{

icon: "üë•",
quote-text: "Diverse User Base",
subquote-text: "Age range from 18 to 89 with varying tech comfort levels"
}

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "‚öïÔ∏è",
quote-text: "Critical Information",
subquote-text: "Users often accessed portal during stressful medical situations"
}

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "üì±",
quote-text: "Mobile Priority",
subquote-text: "67% of users primarily accessed portal via mobile devices"
}

### Information Architecture Redesign

The original portal was organized by administrative functions rather than patient needs. I restructured it around patient journeys:

alt-text: "Site map showing the new patient-centered navigation structure",
caption: "New information architecture organized around patient goals rather than administrative systems"
}

Priority tasks were surfaced prominently:
- View upcoming appointments
- Message healthcare team
- Access recent test results
- Prescription refills

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "3 clicks",
subquote-text: "maximum to reach any critical information"
}

### Accessibility & Inclusive Design

Healthcare portals must be accessible to users with various abilities and comfort levels with technology:

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "‚ôø",
quote-text: "WCAG 2.1 AAA",
subquote-text: "Exceeded standard accessibility requirements"
}

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "üîç",
quote-text: "Readability",
subquote-text: "Medical jargon translated to plain language"
}

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "üéØ",
quote-text: "Large Touch Targets",
subquote-text: "Optimized for users with motor difficulties"
}

Design decisions included:
- High contrast color scheme for visual impairments
- Large, clear typography (minimum 16px)
- Voice-to-text capability for messages
- Multiple ways to complete each task

### Prototyping & Testing

I created progressive prototypes starting with low-fidelity wireframes and advancing to high-fidelity interactive prototypes.

}

Testing revealed significant improvements:

{
type: "quote-subtitle",
quote-text: "I can actually understand what my doctor is telling me now",
subquote-text: "Patient testing feedback"
}

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "89%",
subquote-text: "task completion rate (up from 34%)"
}

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "4.2/5",
subquote-text: "average usability rating (up from 1.8/5)"
}

### Implementation Challenges

Working in healthcare meant navigating complex regulatory requirements:

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "üîê",
quote-text: "HIPAA Compliance",
subquote-text: "Strict privacy requirements affected every design decision"
}

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "‚ö°",
quote-text: "System Integration",
subquote-text: "Multiple legacy systems required careful data mapping"
}

Close collaboration with IT, compliance, and medical staff ensured the design met both user needs and regulatory requirements.

### Results & Impact

The redesigned portal launched in phases over 4 months with careful monitoring and iteration:

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "78%",
subquote-text: "reduction in support calls"
}

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "156%",
subquote-text: "increase in portal adoption"
}

{
type: "data-point",
data-text: "92%",
subquote-text: "patient satisfaction score"
}

type: "image",
image-source: "patient-portal-dashboard.png",
alt-text: "Clean, modern patient portal dashboard showing upcoming appointments and recent results",
caption: "Final dashboard design prioritizing most important patient information with clear visual hierarchy"
}

Unexpected positive outcomes:

type: "quote-subtitle",
quote-text: "Patients are more engaged in their care since the portal redesign",
subquote-text: "Dr. Sarah Chen, Primary Care Physician"
}

### Long-term Impact & Lessons Learned

This project reinforced several key principles for healthcare UX design:

{

icon: "‚ù§Ô∏è",
quote-text: "Empathy First",
subquote-text: "Healthcare users are often stressed, anxious, or in pain"
}

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "üî¨",
quote-text: "Evidence-Based Design",
subquote-text: "Every decision backed by user research and testing"
}

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: "üåç",
quote-text: "Universal Design",
subquote-text: "Designing for accessibility benefits all users"
}

The project has become a template for other healthcare UX initiatives and contributed to improved health outcomes by making medical information more accessible and understandable for patients.

subquote-text: "received healthcare UX design recognition"
}

This experience deepened my understanding of how thoughtful design can have real impact on people's health and wellbeing, making it one of the most meaningful projects of my career.
