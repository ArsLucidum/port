## Banking App Redesign - Improving Financial Literacy

This project focused on redesigning a mobile banking app to make financial management more accessible and educational for younger users.

### Research Phase

I conducted interviews with 20 millennials and gen-z users to understand their banking habits and financial goals.

{
"type": "data-point"
"data-text": "68%",
subquote-text: of users felt overwhelmed by financial jargon
}

The research showed that traditional banking apps often intimidate younger users with complex terminology and cluttered interfaces.

{
type: quote,
text: "I want to understand my money, not just move it around"
}

### Key Insights

Most users wanted educational content integrated into their banking experience:

{
type: "icon-caption",
icon: ðŸ“š,
quote-text: "Learn While Banking",
subquote-text: "Users wanted contextual financial education"
}

{
type: data-point,
data-text: "84%"
subquote-text: "preferred bite-sized learning over long articles"
}

### Design Solutions

I redesigned the app with focus on progressive disclosure and micro-learning:

{
type: 'image',
image-source: banking-app-mockup.jpg,
alt-text: Mobile banking app screens showing clean interface with educational tooltips,
caption: New design featuring educational overlays and simplified transaction history
}

The new design included:
- Contextual tips and explanations
- Gamified savings goals
- Simple budgeting tools

{
type: "quote-subtitle"
quote-text: "Finally, a bank app that doesn't make me feel stupid",
subquote-text: User testing feedback
}

### Results

After launch, the app showed significant improvement in user engagement:

{
type="data-point",
data-text: "156%",
subquote-text: "increase in daily active users"
}

{
type: icon-caption
icon: "ðŸ’¡"
quote-text: "Financial Confidence"
subquote-text: "Users reported feeling more confident about their finances"
}

This project demonstrated how thoughtful UX design can bridge the gap between complex financial systems and everyday user needs.
